## Getting Started  📚

This app started with me wanting to try what I could make after watching a few tutorials 👨‍🏫 on Udacity. The app makes use of AsyncTaskLoaders to asynchronously fetch the api JSON responses similar to the albeit much simpler [QuakeReport](https://github.com/udacity/ud843-QuakeReport) app covered in the [Android Basics: Networking](https://github.com/udacity?q=ud_843) course.

## Pre-requisites 📝

* Minimum SDK version 22 (Android version 5.1.1 Lollipop)

## Libraries Used 👨‍💻

* [Picasso](https://github.com/square/picasso) - Displaying images
* [GraphView](https://github.com/jjoe64/GraphView) - Generating trend charts
* [Shimmer Layout](https://github.com/facebook/shimmer-android) - Shimmer loading effect

## Installing 💻
